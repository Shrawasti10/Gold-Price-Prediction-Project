# Gold-Price-Prediction-Project
Problem Statement : To predict the future gold price using the US Economic Indicators

Gold price prediction is a popular machine learning project that aims to estimate future gold prices using historical market data. Because gold is a volatile asset influenced by many factors — economic indicators, inflation rates, currency strength, and global market sentiment — building a predictive model can provide useful insights for traders and investors.

In this project, we apply data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling techniques (like Random Forest or other algorithms) to forecast gold prices. The end result can be a trained model and a user interface (for example, a simple Python web app) to make predictions in practice.
